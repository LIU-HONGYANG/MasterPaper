## Description

The repository stored the paper finished in my master degree

I mainly use python to finish my paper and some machine learning libraries. Hopefully, this respository can help student who are learning data science in 
their master degree.

The name of this papaer is AUTOMATIC FRAUD DETECTION ON EMPLOYMENT SCAM DATASETS USING MACHINE LEARNING. This can be used for employment scan detection.


## Abstract 

Online recruitment enables the process of sourcing suitable candidates to become effective and efficient, from which job seekers could post their resumes online and search for jobs with little face-to-face interaction. 

However, there is an emerging challenge that fraudulent job adverts have become a severe issue that may influence the credibility of websites, threaten the privacy information security of individuals, and damage the reputation of organizations. 

Some fraudsters pretend to become employers to recruit job seekers on online websites and post job advertisements to deceive victims into sending in their resumes, which might contain sensitive information such as name, telephone number, email, and address. 

Besides, online recruitment website managers are overwhelmed, as identifying the fraudulent recruitment postings is a rather challenging problem and it is almost impossible for website managers to distinguish the fraud job advertisements manually. 

This research objective is analyzing the Employment Scam Datasets and building a Fraud Detection model with the help of Python Libraries to automatically detect the online fraud recruitment scam. 

Multiple machine learning classification techniques were investigated using LR, DT, KNN, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes. 

Besides, we also applied ensemble learning methods such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Xgboost to improve the model performance. 

The results showed that Random Forest outperformed other algorithms and achieved accuracy at 93%. 

For comparison, the result is slightly higher than the previous one. This model is beneficial to recruitment websites to effectively detect fake job advertisements, protect job seekers from privacy information leakage, and prevent fraudsters from damaging the reputation of companies.
